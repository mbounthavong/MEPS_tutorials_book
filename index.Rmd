# About {-} 

This is a collection of tutorials that use data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). 

These tutorials use [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) for data loading, manipulation, analysis, and presentation. 

Chapter 1 provides an introduction on how to load and import the data into R.




```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
