## Introduction
This tutorial will go over the basic setup with `bookdown`, an R package that is used to create HTML books. You can create a `bookdown` project using R / RStudio. 

## Start a `bookdown` project
To start a `bookdown` project, you will need to install the `bookdown` package. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# install.packages("bookdown")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Figure 1 - Selecting bookdown project."}
knitr::include_graphics("Figure 1.png")
```
