# About {-} 

This is a collection of tutorials that use data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) [Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)](https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/). 

These tutorials use [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) for data loading, manipulation, analysis, and presentation. 

The GitHub link to the MEPS tutorials collection: https://mbounthavong.github.io/MEPS_tutorials_book/

Chapter [1](#intro) provides an introduction on how to load and import MEPS data into R.

Chapter [2](#merging) is an instruction on how to merge various MEPS data files.

Chapter [3](#weights) focuses on applying weights to the population.

Further chapters are forthcoming.
